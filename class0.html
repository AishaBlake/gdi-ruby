        <section>
          <h3>A little help from our friends...</h3>
          <p>We'll be using Railsbridge's Installfest instructions to get set up. <a href="http://railsbridge.org/" alt="railsbridge home">Railsbridge</a> is an awesome organization that we're friends with and you should be, too! </p>

          <h3>Installfest</h3>
          <p><a href="http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/" alt="railsbridge installfest">Here it is!</a></p>
          <p>Just work through the instructions for your operating system. Ask a volunteer for help if you get stuck or lost. This entire process should take at least an hour.</p>

        <!-- Part 2: Intro to Terminal, 20 minutes -->
        <section>
          <h3>Intro to Terminal</h3>
          <p>Working in the terminal can be really intimidating!</p>
          <p>With practice, you'll find that navigation and file manipulation is significantly faster in the terminal than in the GUI.</p>
          <p>Professional software developers use the terminal all the time, and this class will require some use of it.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Intro to Terminal</h3>
          <p>Mac & Linux users: Open Terminal</p>
          <p>Windows users: Open Git-Bash</p>
          <p>We will not be using Windows "cmd" program, as it uses a different syntax than *NIX systems.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Terminal Cheatsheet</h3>
          <p>These are the most common commands that we'll be using in the terminal:</p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>pwd</td>
              <td>"present working directory" - where am I?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>cd [location]</td>
              <td>"change directory" - navigate to the location I'm providing</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>ls</td>
              <td>"list" the contents of the current directory</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>ls -al</td>
              <td>"list all" of the contents of current directory, including invisible ones</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>.</td>
              <td>the current directory- ex: "touch ./wow.txt"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>..</td>
              <td>the parent of current directory - ex: "cd ../RubyParty"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>~</td>
              <td>the root directory- ex: "cd ~/Pictures"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>touch [filename.extension]</td>
              <td>create a file called filename.extension in the current directory</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>mkdir [directoryname]</td>
              <td>create a directory called directoryname in the current directory</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>rm [filename]</td>
              <td>"remove" (delete) the file called filename</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>rm -rf [directoryname]</td>
              <td>"remove recursively with force" the directory called directoryname</td>
            </tr>            
          </table>
