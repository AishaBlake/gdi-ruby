## Classes

### Class 0 

Installfest & Intro to Command Line

Get your developement environment set up on your machine. Install Ruby, Rails, and Git, with the assistance of some helpful volunteers. We'll also have a brief lecture on working with the command line.

### Class 1

Intro to programming in Ruby

What is programming? What is Ruby? We'll give you some context for the class, then dive right into writing code! Using the Interactive Ruby Shell, we'll begin experimenting with variables, methods, and data types. We'll end the class by writing a little interactive command line program.

### Class 2

Structured programming (loops and conditions), working with collections

We'll create small programs in the text editor that use conditionals and loops for control flow. Then, we'll explore Ruby's collections data types, and see some of the ways we can work with them. 

### Class 3

Object Oriented Programming, part I

We'll discuss the basic concepts of object oriented programming. We'll write our own methods, and explore some of the predefined methods that are available in Ruby for certain classes of object.

### Class 4

Object Oriented Programming, part II

We will expand our knowledge of OOP by discussing classes and inheritence. We will tie together everything we've learned with a relatively complex, totally fun final project.
