                  <h3>Objects</h3>
                  <p>An <strong>object</strong> is the building block of a program.</p>
                  <p class="fragment">There will be many objects all working together to get something done.</p>
                  <p class="fragment">An object can represent something in real life like a Coffee or something you can't see like a Birthday or an action like the Path you walk around Green Lake.</p>
                  <p class="fragment">Objects are capable of <strong>doing things</strong>. They also have <strong>properties</strong> like color or size.</p>
                <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
Object: Bike
What can it do?
- Exist
- Go
- Brake
- Pop a Wheelie

What are some properties of your Bike?
- Brand
- Size
- Wheel Size
- Number of Speeds
- Material

                <h3>Object Class</h3>
                <p><strong>Objects</strong> can be grouped by Class.</p>
                <p class="fragment">Classes define a template for objects. They describe what a certain type of object can do and what properties they have in common.</p>

                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>A <strong>method</strong> is a series of statements. Sometimes methods are called functions.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Methods are often used to communicate between objects.</p>
                    <p class="fragment">For example, a Bike object might receive a message to `pop_wheelie`.</p>
                    <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
class Bike

  def pop_wheelie
    puts "popped wheelie!!"
  end

end

bike = Bike.new
bike.pop_wheelie
=> "popped wheelie!!"

              <section>
                  <h3>Built in Methods</h3>
                  <p>Some methods have already been defined on your object.</p>
                  <p>For example, we can call `new` on Bike to create a new instance from our Bike template</p>
                  <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
bike = Bike.new
bike.methods

bike.methods - Object.methods

              <section>
                  <h3>Object Methods</h3>
                  <p>Methods have access to the properties of their objects.</p>

                  <p>Methods can do things with data given to them.</p>

                  <h3>Methods & Variables</h3>
                  <p>Local variables are only available in the methods where they were defined.</p>
                  <p>Instance variables are available to all the methods in the class.</p>

                  <h3>Methods & Return Values</h3>
                  <p>Every Ruby method returns something.</p>
                  <p>Usually, it's the last statement in the method.</p>
                  <p>If you don't want to return the last statement, you'll use a reserved word <strong>return</strong></p>
                  <p>Notice that the method <strong>puts</strong> returns nil</p>

                  <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
def return_early
  return "This is what you get!"
  1*2
end

return_early
=> "This is what you get!"

puts "Hi!"
"Hi"

              <section>
                  <h3>Objects Working Together</h3>
                  <p>Object Oriented Programming is one of many programming approaches: procedural, event-driven, functional, declarative...</p>
                  <p>All this means is that programs are organized around objects (data & methods).</p>
                  <p>You might choose OOP because Objects make things easier to understand and act as a natural way to modularize code. When a large code base is composed of many small Objects, it is easier to maintain and change.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                  <h3>OOP & Easy Understanding</h3>
                  <p>Objects often take on names from their domain which makes them easy to conceptualize.</p>
                  <p>For example, without seeing my code, you can probably guess what my Bike can do (or not do)</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                  <h3>OOP & Maintenance</h3>
                  <p>One thing that makes code easier to maintain is Encapsulation which is one of the fundamentals of OOP.</p>
                  <p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> is a nice way of saying 'put all my properties/behaviors in my capsule where other objects can't touch them'.</p>
                  <p>By assigning certain responsibilities to objects, code is more purposeful and less likely to be changed by accident.</p>
              </section>

              <section>
                  <h3>OOP & Complexity</h3>
                  <p>As code becomes more complex, we as programmers need to think about which parts of the object are relevant to others.</p>
                  <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is used to say only what is needed.</p>
                  <p>For example, your Bike might have tire_pressure and spoke_count properties that help indicate whether the bike is being maintained. Other objects may not need to know the actual maintenance details and you might be able to abstract this data out into a more relevant method `maintained?`.</p>
                <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
class Bike
  def perform_maintenance
    @tires_filled = YES
    @cleaned = YES
    @bolts_tightened = YES
  end

  def maintained?
    @tires_filled & @cleaned & @bolts_tightened
  end
end

              </section>

              <section>
                  <h3>OOP & Borrowing</h3>
                  <p>Just as you inherited traits from your mom, your objects may inherit traits from other objects.</p>
                  <p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is when you use on class as the basis for another.</p>
                  <p>You might use Inheritance if two objects have the same properties and methods. This way you don't need to write the same thing twice.</p>
                <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
 class RoadBike < Bike
 end

 road_bike = RoadBike.new
 road_bike.perform_maintenance
                 </code></pre>
              </section>

              <section>
                <h3>OOP & Ducks</h3>
                <p>Similar to inherited traits and behaviors, there are also polymorphic traits and behaviors.</p>
                <p><strong>Polymorphic</strong> means that something can take on many forms.</p>
                <p>Within OOP, this relates to different objects being able to respond to the same message in different ways.</p>
                <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
class Fixie
 def gears
   1
 end
end

class RoadBike
 def gears
   21
