          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Methods</h3>
          <p>A <strong>method</strong> is a series of statements, also called a function.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Methods are often used to define reusable behavior.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Let's look at a method we've already used:</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
irb>1 + 1
=> 2
  </code></pre>
          <p class="fragment">The `+` here is actually a method. You can view the code for this method in the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/Fixnum.html#method-i-2B">ruby-docs</a>.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Because `+` has been defined, you can use it many times without re-writing how addition works.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Built in Methods</h3>
          <p>Ruby has already defined many methods for you.</p>
          <p>For example, we can find out if a number is even using <strong>.even?</strong> or capitalize names with <strong>.capitalize</strong>.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    1.even?
    => false

    "fred".capitalize
    => "Fred"

    # Here's a trick to look at all the methods on a String
    "fred".methods - Object.methods
  </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Method Input</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Some methods use data that you give them.</li>
            <li class="fragment">Let's continue looking at "fred" and a new method <strong>.center</strong></li>
            <li class="fragment">This method will place "fred" at the center of a new String with a padding of your choice on the sides.</li>
          </ul>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
     # This places our 4 character String 'fred' at the center
     # of a 20 character String with hyphens on the sides.
     "fred".center(20, "-")
     => "--------fred--------"
  </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Write a Method</h3>
          <p>Let's write a version of `center` that always uses hyphens to the sides.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    # To define a method start with `def` followed by the method name
    # `centered_with_hyphens` and any data it looks at
    # `(passed_in_string)`. Use `end` at the end.

    def centered_with_hyphens(passed_in_string)
      passed_in_string.center(20, "-")
    end

    "fred".centered_with_hyphens
    => "--------fred--------"
  </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Methods & Return Values</h3>
          <p>Every Ruby method returns something.</p>
          <p>Usually, it's the last statement in the method.</p>
          <p>If you don't want to return the last statement, you'll use a reserved word <strong>return</strong></p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    # These two methods return the same thing

    def centered_with_hyphens(passed_in_string)
      passed_in_string.center(20, "-")
    end

    def centered_with_hyphens(passed_in_string)
      return passed_in_string.center(20, "-")
    end
  </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Methods & Variables</h3>
          <p><strong>Local vars</strong> are only available in the methods where they were defined.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    # Let's extract the length of the padded string into
    # a local variable
    def centered_with_hyphens(passed_in_string)
      new_length = 20
      passed_in_string.center(new_length, "-")
    end

    # If we define a new method, it will not know what
    # new_length is

    def centered_with_at_signs(passed_in_string)
      passed_in_string.center(new_length, "@")
    end

    irb> centered_with_at_signs('fred')

  </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Objects</h3>
          <p>An <strong>Object</strong> is the building block of a program.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Objects <strong>do things</strong> and have <strong>properties</strong>.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    Object: Number
    What can it do?
    - Add
    - Subtract
    - Divide
    - Multiply

    What are some properties of your Number?
    - Length
    - Base
    - Even
  </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Object Class</h3>
          <p><strong>Objects</strong> can be grouped by Class.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Classes define a template for objects. They describe what a certain type of object can do and what
            properties they have in common.
          </p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    # Engineer in Trek headquarters defines
    # what it takes to build a bike Object
    class Bike
    end

    # Fabricator uses template to build a new Bike
    bike = Bike.new

    # Consumer buying a bike asks which template was used
    # to fabricate the bike
    bike.class
    => Bike
  </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Object Methods</h3>
          <p>Methods have access to the properties of their objects.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class Bike
      def set_brand
        # Object property is noted with an @
        @brand = "Fuji"
      end

      def get_brand
        puts "The brand of the bike is: #{@brand}"
      end
    end

    bike = Bike.new
    bike.set_brand
    bike.get_brand
    => "The brand of the bike is: Fuji"
  </code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Objects Working Together</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Object Oriented Programming is one of many <strong>programming approaches</strong>: procedural, event-driven, functional,
              declarative...
            </li>
            <li class="fragment">All this means is that programs are <strong>organized around objects</strong> (data & methods).</li>
            <li class="fragment">You might choose OOP because Objects make things <strong>easier to understand</strong> and act as a natural way to modularize code.
              When a large code base is composed of many small Objects, it is <strong>easier to maintain</strong> and change.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Easy Understanding</h3>
          <p>Objects often take on names from their domain which makes them easy to conceptualize.</p>
          <p>For example, without seeing my code, you can probably guess what my Bike can do (or not do)</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Maintenance</h3>
          <p>One thing that makes code easier to maintain is Encapsulation which is one of the fundamentals of OOP.</p>
          <p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> is a nice way of saying 'put all my properties/behaviors in my capsule where other
            objects can't touch them'.
          </p>
          <p>By assigning certain responsibilities to objects, code is more purposeful and less likely to be changed by
            accident.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Complexity</h3>
          <p>As code becomes more complex, we as programmers need to think about which parts of the object are relevant to
            others.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is used to say only what is needed.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class Bike
      def perform_maintenance
        @tires_filled = YES
        @cleaned = YES
        @bolts_tightened = YES
      end

      # Abstract maintenance details into a relevant method
      def maintained?
        @tires_filled & @cleaned & @bolts_tightened
      end
    end
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Borrowing</h3>
          <p>Just as you inherited traits from your mom, your objects may inherit traits from other objects.</p>
          <p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is when you use one class as the basis for another.</p>
          <p>You might use Inheritance if two objects have the same properties and methods. This way you don't need to write the
            same thing twice.
          </p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class RoadBike < Bike
    end

    road_bike = RoadBike.new
    road_bike.perform_maintenance
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Ducks</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>Similar to inherited traits and behaviors, there are also polymorphic traits and behaviors.</li>
          <li><strong>Polymorphic</strong> means many forms.</li>
          <li>Within OOP, this relates to different objects being able to respond to the same message in different ways.</li>
            </ul>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class Fixie
      def gears
        1
      end
    end
    class RoadBike
      def gears
        21
      end
    end
            
    [RoadBike.new, Fixie.new].each {|bike| puts bike.gears}
