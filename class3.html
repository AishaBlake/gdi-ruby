          <h3>Objects</h3>
          <p>An <strong>Object</strong> is the building block of a program.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Objects <strong>do things</strong> and have <strong>properties</strong>.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    Object: Bike
    What can it do?
    - Exist
    - Go
    - Brake
    - Wheelie

    What are some properties of your Bike?
    - Brand
    - Size
    - Speeds
    - Material
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Object Class</h3>
          <p><strong>Objects</strong> can be grouped by Class.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Classes define a template for objects. They describe what a certain type of object can do and what
            properties they have in common.
          </p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    # Engineer in Trek headquarters defines
    # what it takes to build a bike
    class Bike
    end

    # Fabricator uses template to build a Trek bike
    bike = Bike.new

    # Consumer buying a bike asks which template was used
    # to fabricate the bike
    bike.class
    => Bike
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Methods</h3>
          <p>A <strong>method</strong> is a series of statements, also called a function.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Methods are often used to communicate between objects.</p>
          <p class="fragment">For example, a Bike object might `go`.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class Bike
      # In Ruby, we define a method beginning with `def` followed
      # by the method name `go` and ending with `end`
      def go
        puts "going!!"
      end
    end

    # Fabricate a new bike
    bike = Bike.new

    # Send a message/Call a method on that bike. Tell it to `go`
    bike.go
    => "going!!"
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Built in Methods</h3>
          <p>Some methods have already been defined on your object.</p>
          <p>For example, we can call `new` on Bike to create a new instance from our Bike template.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    bike = Bike.new

    # Look at all the things our bike can do
    bike.methods

    # Look at methods specific to bike
    bike.methods - Object.methods

  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Object Methods</h3>
          <p>Methods have access to the properties of their objects.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class Bike
      def set_brand
        @brand = "Fuji"
      end

      def get_brand
        puts "The brand of the bike is: #{@brand}"
      end
    end

    bike = Bike.new
    bike.set_brand
    bike.get_brand
    => "The brand of the bike is: Fuji"
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Method Input</h3>
          <p>Methods can operate on data given to them.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class Bike
      def set_brand
        @brand = "Fuji"
      end

      def get_brand
        puts "The brand of the bike is: #{@brand}"
      end

      def go_speed(speed)
        if speed < 15
          puts "Safety first."
        else
          puts "Speed racer!"
        end
      end
    end

  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Methods & Variables</h3>
          <p><strong>Local vars</strong> are only available in the methods where they were defined.</p>
          <p><strong>Instance vars</strong> are available to all the methods in the class.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class Bike
      def set_brand
        @brand = "Fuji"
      end

      def go_speed(speed)
        if speed < 15
          puts "Safety first."
        else
          puts "Speed racer!"
        end
      end

      def get_speed
        puts speed
      end
    end

    bike = Bike.new
    bike.get_speed
    => NameError: undefined local variable or method `speed'
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Methods & Return Values</h3>
          <p>Every Ruby method returns something.</p>
          <p>Usually, it's the last statement in the method.</p>
          <p>If you don't want to return the last statement, you'll use a reserved word <strong>return</strong></p>
          <p>Notice that the method <strong>puts</strong> returns nil</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    def return_early
    return "This is what you get!"
    1*2
    end

    return_early
    => "This is what you get!"

    puts "Hi!"
    "Hi"
    => nil

          <h3>Objects Working Together</h3>
          <ul>
            <li class="fragment">Object Oriented Programming is one of many <strong>programming approaches</strong>: procedural, event-driven, functional,
              declarative...
            </li>
            <li class="fragment">All this means is that programs are <strong>organized around objects</strong> (data & methods).</li>
            <li class="fragment">You might choose OOP because Objects make things <strong>easier to understand</strong> and act as a natural way to modularize code.
              When a large code base is composed of many small Objects, it is <strong>easier to maintain</strong> and change.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Easy Understanding</h3>
          <p>Objects often take on names from their domain which makes them easy to conceptualize.</p>
          <p>For example, without seeing my code, you can probably guess what my Bike can do (or not do)</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Maintenance</h3>
          <p>One thing that makes code easier to maintain is Encapsulation which is one of the fundamentals of OOP.</p>
          <p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> is a nice way of saying 'put all my properties/behaviors in my capsule where other
            objects can't touch them'.
          </p>
          <p>By assigning certain responsibilities to objects, code is more purposeful and less likely to be changed by
            accident.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Complexity</h3>
          <p>As code becomes more complex, we as programmers need to think about which parts of the object are relevant to
            others.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is used to say only what is needed.</p>
          <p>For example, your Bike might have tire_pressure and spoke_count properties that help indicate whether the bike is
            being maintained. Other objects may not need to know the actual maintenance details and you might be able to
            abstract this data out into a more relevant method `maintained?`.
          </p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class Bike
    def perform_maintenance
    @tires_filled = YES
    @cleaned = YES
    @bolts_tightened = YES
    end

    def maintained?
    @tires_filled & @cleaned & @bolts_tightened
    end
    end
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Borrowing</h3>
          <p>Just as you inherited traits from your mom, your objects may inherit traits from other objects.</p>
          <p><strong>Inheritance</strong> is when you use one class as the basis for another.</p>
          <p>You might use Inheritance if two objects have the same properties and methods. This way you don't need to write the
            same thing twice.
          </p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class RoadBike < Bike
    end

    road_bike = RoadBike.new
    road_bike.perform_maintenance
  </code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>OOP & Ducks</h3>
          <p>Similar to inherited traits and behaviors, there are also polymorphic traits and behaviors.</p>
          <p><strong>Polymorphic</strong> means that something can take on many forms.</p>
          <p>Within OOP, this relates to different objects being able to respond to the same message in different ways.</p>
          <pre><code contenteditable class="fragment ruby">
    class Fixie
    def gears
    1
    end
    end

    class RoadBike
    def gears
    21
    end
    end

    [RoadBike.new, Fixie.new].each {|bike| puts bike.gears}
